<a id="what-is-functional-programming" class="anchor" href="#what-is-functional-programming" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Functional Programming?</h2>

<p>Functional Programming is when functions, not objects or procedures, are used as the fundamental building blocks of a program. Functions in this sense, not to be confused with C language functions which are just procedures, are analogous to mathematical equations: they declare a relationship between two or more entities.
Functional Programming, however, is not about mathematics but about abstraction and reducing complexity: as such, it provides a powerful paradigm in which to tackle complex, real-world programming tasks.</p>

<p>Functional programming typically avoids using mutable state.</p>

<p>Functional Programming Languages, which support this style of programming, provide at least some of the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>FirstClass functions</li>
<li>HigherOrderFunctions</li>
<li>LexicalClosures</li>
<li>PatternMatching</li>
<li>SingleAssignment</li>
<li>LazyEvaluation</li>
<li>GarbageCollection</li>
<li>TypeInference</li>
<li>TailCallOptimization</li>
<li>ListComprehensions</li>
<li>Monadic effects [OnMonads]</li>
</ul>

<p>These features enable or support the following aims:</p>

<ul>
<li>shorter programs (lower lines-to-effect ratio)</li>
<li>program correctness</li>
<li>expressive programs</li>
</ul>

<a id="firstclass-functions" class="anchor" href="#firstclass-functions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FirstClass functions?</h3>

<hr>

<p>FirstClass functions means that they are treated like any other values and can be passed as arguments to other functions or be returned as a result of a function. Being first-class also means that it is possible to define and manipulate functions from within other functions. Special attention needs to be given to functions that reference local variables from their scope. If such a function escapes their block after being returned from it, the local variables must be retained in memory, as they might be needed later when the function is called. Often it is difficult to determine statically when those resources can be released, so it is necessary to use automatic memory management.</p>

<h3>
<a id="higher-order-functions" class="anchor" href="#higher-order-functions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Higher-order functions?</h3>

<hr>

<p>Higher-order functions (HOFs) are functions that take other functions as their arguments. A basic example of a HOF is map which takes a function and a list as its arguments, applies the function to all elements of the list, and returns the list of its results. For instance, we can write a function that subtracts 2 from all elements of a list without using loops or recursion:
subtractTwoFromList l = map (\x -&gt; x - 2) l
We can generalize this function to subtract any given number:</p>

<p>subtractFromList l y = map (\x -&gt; x - y) l
The function given to map then becomes a closure because \x -&gt; x - y references a local variable y from outside its body.
Higher-order functions are very useful for refactoring code and reduce the amount of repetition. For example, typically most for loops can be expressed using maps or folds. Custom iteration schemes, such as parallel loops, can be easily expressed using HOFs.</p>

<p>Higher-order functions are often used to implement domain-specific languages.</p>

<p>Higher-order functions can be usually simulated in object-oriented languages by functions that take function-objects, also called functors. Variables from the scope of the call can be bound inside the function-object which acts as if it were a closure. This way of simulating HOFs is, however, very verbose and requires declaring a new class each time we want to use a HOF.</p>

<h2>
<a id="lexicalclosures" class="anchor" href="#lexicalclosures" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>LexicalClosures</h2>

<p>A LexicalClosure, often referred to just as a closure, are typically (but not always) formed by defining a function inside another function.</p>

<p>A lexical closure is called just like an ordinary function. When this happens, the code of the closure is executed, and the references to the 'captured' LexicalVariable's just work. For this, the captured lexicals must be saved somehow, in an object that persists as long as the closure exists. This means the lexical variables can't be stored in an ordinary stack frame that expires when the execution of the outer LexicalScope is finished.</p>

<p>The closure has internal variables too, such as the parameters of its anonymous function, or local variables defined within the body of that function. These are the closure's bound variables, and are not included in the closure object, because their bindings are established whenever the closure is called. The captured variables from the surrounding environments are called free variables (that is, free with respect to the function because they are not bound within it but have to be "reached" for in the lexical environment). It's useful to know this free variable terminology because it's somewhat counter-intuitive, yet used quite a bit in the literature.</p>
