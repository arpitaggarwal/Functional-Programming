{"name":"Functional Programming","tagline":"Functional Programming","body":"## What is Functional Programming?\r\n\r\nFunctional Programming is when functions, not objects or procedures, are used as the fundamental building blocks of a program. Functions in this sense, not to be confused with C language functions which are just procedures, are analogous to mathematical equations: they declare a relationship between two or more entities.\r\nFunctional Programming, however, is not about mathematics but about abstraction and reducing complexity: as such, it provides a powerful paradigm in which to tackle complex, real-world programming tasks.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
